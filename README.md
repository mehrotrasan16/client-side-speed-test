# client-side-speed-test

- Very simple and most likely inaccurate download speed test. Only works on local files whose size is known.
- Tried to write an old-timey simple speed calculator by referencing an [older](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51848255/client-side-speed-test?answertab=active#tab-top) stack-overflow post. 
- Blocked by CORS errors and only the total time calcualtion works. 
- Size is broken and speed calculated as **Speed = size/time** is also broken.
